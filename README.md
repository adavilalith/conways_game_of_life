## About the Project

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. This project is a React-based implementation of the game, where the evolution of cells is determined by simple rules. The game is played on a two-dimensional grid, and the cells can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The game evolves over generations based on the initial state of the cells. [Learn more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)

## How to Play

- Click on the grid cells to toggle their state between alive and dead.
- Use the "Start" button to initiate the evolution of the cells.
- Press "Stop" to pause the evolution at any time.
- You can manually progress to the next generation using the "Next" button.
- Clear the grid with the "Clear" button.
- Experiment with different initial patterns to observe their evolution.

## Installation
